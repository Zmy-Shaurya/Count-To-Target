# 🎯 Count To Target Game

A fun little math game built with **React** — made for learning about **React State (useState)**, event handling, and conditional rendering.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- The game will give you a **random target number** between **1 and 9999**.
- You can use math operation buttons:
  - ➕ Increment  
  - ➖ Decrement  
  - 0️⃣ Zero  
  - 2️⃣ Double  
  - ½ Half  
  - ⏹️ Square  
  - √ Root
- The goal is to **reach the target number** in the **least number of moves**!
